## GEi overall description

OFNIC is a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller for OpenFlow-enabled networks. It enables the abstraction and virtualization of network resources and functionalities. It offers a RESTful interface in order to get information about the network topology components and elements either real or virtual. OFNIC also monitors the status of the network and provides near real-time data about network statistics with different levels of granularity (flow, node, port). Moreover it is capable of controlling the network forwarding capabilities and thus it is able to establish end-to-end paths with given requirements between any two nodes in the network.
